## Who Am I? That Doesn't Matter.  

This book does not include an **"About Me"** page.  

Why?  
Because this movement **does not need a leader.**  

If you feel the vision, if you resonate with the ideas, then **you are already part of it.**  
This is not about following someone.  
This is about **co-creating a new world â€“ together.**  

But if youâ€™re still curious about who I am,  
if you want to know **how I got here**,  
youâ€™ll find the answers in my other [books](https://books.crowdware.at/index.html).  

The real question is not **who I am.**  
The real question is **who you will become.**  

ðŸš€ **Will you just read this book â€“ or will you take action?**
